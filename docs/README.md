# lazaro
L치zaro is a model for extracting English lexical borrowings (or *anglicisms*) from Spanish newswire. 

* The conditional random field model and annotated corpus for automatic extraction of anglicisms in Spanish newswire can be found [in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/lirondos/lazaro).
* A Twitter bot ```@lazarobot``` that tweets anglicisms found on the daily press of Spain was created using the CRF model. The can be followed [at @lazarobot](https://twitter.com/lazarobot). The code behind ```lazarobot``` can be found [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/lirondos/lazarobot).
* The model, corpus, motivation and theoretical approach behind L치zaro is explained in the paper [*An Annotated Corpus of Emerging Anglicisms in Spanish Newspaper Headlines*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02929)
* The name of this project, L치zaro, is an homage to Spanish philologist [Fernando L치zaro Carreter](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_L%C3%A1zaro_Carreter), whose columns admonishing against the usage of anglicisms on the Spanish press became extremely popular during the decades of 1980s and 1990s
