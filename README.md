Lázaro is a model for extracting English lexical borrowings (or *anglicisms*) from Spanish newswire. Lázaro processes daily the articles published in 8 major Spanish newspapers (elDiario.es, El País, ABC, El Mundo, El Confidencial, La Vanguardia, 20minutos, EFE) and extracts the anglicisms it finds.
* The model and training corpus behind Lázaro can be found [in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/lirondos/lazaro).
* A Twitter bot ```@lazarobot``` that tweets the new anglicisms found by Lázaro on the daily press of Spain can be followed [at @lazarobot](https://twitter.com/lazarobot). 
* The model, corpus, motivation and theoretical approach behind Lázaro is explained in the paper [*An Annotated Corpus of Emerging Anglicisms in Spanish Newspaper Headlines*](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.calcs-1.1/) and in my MS thesis [*Lázaro: An Extractor of Emergent Anglicisms in Spanish Newswire*](http://bir.brandeis.edu/handle/10192/37532).
* The name of this project, Lázaro, is an homage to Spanish philologist [Fernando Lázaro Carreter](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_L%C3%A1zaro_Carreter), whose columns admonishing against the usage of anglicisms on the Spanish press became extremely popular during the decades of 1980s and 1990s
